Technical Assessment
This repository contains the materials for the DocuSign Global Customer Support candidate technical assessment.
Please utilize the contents of this repository to complete the following tasks:
1.	Modify the API call in API TEST 1 to send successfully.
2.	Attempt to make the API call in API TEST 2 successfully. Be prepared to explore this scenario in-depth during your technical interview.
3.	Create a successful API call to DocuSign that creates a single DocuSign envelope that combines the templates TestJSON1 and TestJSON2 and is directed to the following recipients: John Doe, johndoe@test.test and Jane Doe, janedoe@test.test.
When prompted, please return your completed API calls to your recruiting coordinator.
NOTICE
Please be prepared to discuss your progress during the technical portion of your interview, up to and including running the API calls live during the interview. If you were unsuccessful at any portion of this assessment, please be prepared to discuss the obstacles you encountered and the steps you attempted to move forward.

Prerequisite: 
•	Create a DocuSign Developer account
•	Install Postman
•	Configure DocuSign API Postman Collection 
See the Appendix Section for a step-by-step guide.
API TEST 1
1.	Modify the API call in API TEST 1 to send successfully.

Figure 1- Raw code for API TEST 1 before any edits

Initial Observations:
•	Header is a POST request to DocuSign envelope 
o	POST requests are adding data to the server 
o	Body contents contain metadata about recipients/signers
o	Assumption: some form of contract is sent to two signatories
•	Body contains a few possible errors:
o	First signer email address domain name appears invalid: ends with @jakedstest.xyz , not a .com, .edu etc.
o	Assumption: each signer is a different person
	recipientID for both signers are the same
o	Signer 2 email parameter is  blank
o	Only 1 document is sent, however each signer has received a unique documentID.
Steps Taken:
•	Converted documentBase64 to physical document via https://base64.guru/converter/decode/file
•	Note: file is a blank document.  If this were a real example this would be a call-out.
•	Paste code as-is to Postman:

Figure 15 – Success message received in body for as-is run


Based off the successful as-is run, the question now is: “what is the functional goal here?”.

Possibility #1: Hide a Document in Envelope from Recipient
•	enforceSignerVisibility set to true provides a hint.  
o	Parameter is typically set in the context of excluding recipients from viewing certain documents .  
•	As an envelope can contain many documents, excludedDocuments parameter should be in place to specify which document is hidden from which recipient.
Assumption:
•	For an example, let’s add a second document to the envelope and exclude Bruce Wayne from viewing.  
•	Barry Allen should see both files (test1.pdf and test2.pdf) while Bruce Wayne should only see test1.pdf
•	This requires adding an additional document to documents section, along with an “excludedDocuments” parameter with the recipient













Updated Code:

Figure 19 – DocuSign envelope received to Bruce Wayne, containing only specified file (and not both files)


 Possibility #2: Routing Order
•	Perhaps the author instead intended for Barry Allen to sign first, then Bruce Wayne to sign second.  
•	This can be accomplished via a defined routingOrder parameter.  
•	The code for this scenario is included in figure 16 but is commented out.

Further Enhancements/ Notes: 
•	Saved documentBase64 as a global variable to improve readability
•	Account -> Sending Settings -> Document Visibility cannot be turned to “Off”

API TEST 3

Create a successful API call to DocuSign that creates a single DocuSign envelope that combines the templates TestJSON1 and TestJSON2 and is directed to the following recipients: John Doe, johndoe@test.test and Jane Doe, janedoe@test.test.

Steps Taken:
•	Fed in raw JSON to Postman, “beautify”
•	Converted documentBase64 to variable
•	Converted to file using  https://base64.guru/converter/decode/file
o	Note: had to clean up using https://base64.guru/tools/repair
•	John Doe’s file:

Figure 21 - File contained within TestJSON2


•	The desired data structure which combines multiple templates to one envelope is a “composite template” 
•	Task 1: upload JSON files as Templates within DocuSign 

 ![image](https://github.com/awhouser213/TechAssess/assets/62894602/92d00349-106d-40db-9369-f7ac3fc27930)
Figure 22 – JSON Templated uploaded within DocuSign


•	Template 1 ID: 79cae74e-afe7-45c4-8e8f-63b94947f742
•	Template 2 ID: d6163c00-0a85-4554-8a87-98aa176972b2

•	Task 2: Create composite template
•	Adapt the format outlined here  with the requirements defined in the assignment
o	Note: we can ignore the “document” portion of the composite template as this is included in the serverTemplate template

Further Enhancements/ Notes: 
•	Error: "Freeform signing is not allowed for your account because it conflicts with other settings, please place signing tabs for each signer."
•	Fix:  set Document Visibility to “Off”
o	OR: add tab within JSON
